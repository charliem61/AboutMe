Goal/Motivation :

        To update my old profile the beginging of class. Links to Git, Linked in, a downloadable link to my current Resume. Update 3, make projects have link to follow to the project.

Problem Solved : 

      Adding clickable links for projects on page.

The Standouts:

        Imgs are clickable that bring you to the repo.

Challenges Faced:

        Once anchors were applied, imgs needed to be reformatted to keep size.
